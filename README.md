"We're optimistic. We think Virtual Reality (VR) is going great. It's going in a way that's consistent with our expectations, that said, we're also pretty comfortable with the idea that it will turn out to be a complete failure." -Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve

# Future proofing VR.
Whether its looking at what type of controller is best in VR (1), What evaluation method is best for it(2), how to display User Interfaces(UI)(3), How your body adapts to it(4), what should the definitions of real and virtual be as they become indistinguishable(5) and what should be done to make using VR safer(6) you are thinking of the future of VR and where it may go. What new and exciting things can be done in VR and what old things have to be rethought to make them work in VR. The technology is still in its infancy and everyone who is contributing to it is laying out the groundwork for what developers and designers and researchers of the future will be doing without thinking about it in the future. Nowadays if you are making an First Person Shooter you do not even think of the control scheme obviously its WASD to move Space to jump Mouse to look and shoot but it wasn't like that back when the first FPS came out (7) and that is where we are at with VR right now the concrete has not set and everyone is leaving footsteps for future developers to follow.  
The thing is because there is no "right way to do it" its going to take a lot of trial and error to get there by doing research you start exploring what feels better in VR (1), What makes sense more sense in UI(3), but then you need to think about how you are conducting the research, the old ways need to be repurposed(2) is it even valuable information for future developers to read the current research if the terms used are not well defined(5). And with VR comes a whole new dimension of how the human body adapts to it psychologically, things that have never been though about are now possible (4), but there is no basis for VR, no rules (6). It is the wild west of research and we the consumers are the guinea pigs. The technology for VR at this level of immersion has not existed for long and it is already in the hands of consumers around the globe.  
Will people in the future be looking back at VR and saying "Wow, I can't believe we let people do that" knowing that there is some long term lasting effect VR use does to the body. We can not anticipate what is around the next corner for VR all we can do is prepare for the unexpected and go from there. Will VR even be the dominant Head Mounted Display (HMD) with things like Microsoft Hololense with their Artificial Reality(AR) headset avoiding the pitfalls of VR motion sickness. Maybe people will prefer the virtual world being brought to them instead of the other way around. But in the end it is going to come down to content as Gabe Newell states, "I can't point to a single piece of content that would cause millions of people to justify changing their home computing." Right now VR is just more accessible for developers your not really changing much to the workflow of developing in VR as you still need to build the world, its just the way the user interacts in your world that needs to be changed. But with AR technology you need both to think about the user interaction with your world, but also your worlds interaction with their space.
